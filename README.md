# PaxOS 8

![Logo of the paxo project](logo.png)

**PaxOS 8** is the latest version of **PaxOS**, a lightweight operating system for PaxoPhones. 

## what's new ?

It brings a very reliable event system allowing a very fluid use of the device. Its new graphic module adds new, more aesthetic widgets in a precise theme designed on figma!

The homepage features 8 simplistic apps but none too many:

- The phone app for making calls
- The message app, to send bubble messages to contacts
- The contacts app, which allows you to add and delete contacts that can be used in other applications
- The Calculator
- Tte Clock, which will allows you to program alarms and launch stopwatches and timers
- The Map to calculate its GPS coordinates
- The Snake
- The game 2048

Many improvements are coming soon.

Feel free to suggest contributions.
